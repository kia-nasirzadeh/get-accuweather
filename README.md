appreciate me with giving a star to me â˜». (it's at the top-right of this page)

truth be told, actually this was an employment test project I coded for a company called *"sperloos"* but it worth to be on my github since it may help someone else

this simple little cli tool helps you to get climate properties of a month(s)/day(s) in your desired file sourced on accuweather.com

# install

installing with npm:

```
npm i -g get-accuweather
```

#### any advice for a common error?

yes, 
1- you may encounter with `Failed to set up Chromium <some-chromium-version>` , that's just because of your connection, try to change your IP & DNS and it will be ok :)
2- in input file be careful about BOM char and final char and \r\n or \n in other words **last char must not be a new line of a BOM or ...**
3- this problem is in ToDo but be careful, if you want to use this on a linux os line breaks may cause problems...

# usage

for instance assume you want to retrieve the property of a day in a file called `output.txt`:

```
# powershell script:
New-Item output.txt
New-Item input.txt
$source = "https://www.accuweather.com/en/gb/london/ec4a-2/daily-weather-forecast/328328?day=1"
Set-Content .\input.txt $source
get-accuweather set input.json
get-accuweather get days json .\output.txt
```



**important Notice 1:** the contents of the input file must **only** includes *days links* or *months links*, in other words it **you shouldn't mix days and months links with each other in a file**

**important Notice 2:** use a full screen or maximized shell, otherwise you maybe encounter UI bugs

**important Notice 3:** accuweather.com has no data for passed days, so use this tool for coming days and months
